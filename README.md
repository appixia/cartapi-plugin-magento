Appixia Cart API Plugin for Magento Commerce
============================================

### Important Node

This community-developed plugin is incomplete. You are welcome to help and join the development effort.

### Introduction

Appixia apps communicate with the Magento cart using a custom web service (XML over HTTP). This cart plugin for Magento implements the web service from the cart side and should be installed as a Magento extension on the merchant's store. Read more about cart integration in [Appixia Knowkedgebase](http://kb.appixia.com/cart).

The plugin is developed by Appixia Magento community and used as-is. The plugin is not designed to be changed during your integration process, although you have the full plugin source-code (PHP). If you wish to change the core plugin, join the Appixia open source development community in [Github](https://github.com/appixia?tab=repositories).
